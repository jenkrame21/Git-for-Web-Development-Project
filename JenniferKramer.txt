    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
        1. You create your own version of Repo by forking a code first, thus changing "Lambda School" to your name.
        2. You then add your TL as a collaborator on your forked Repo by clicking on settings in your Repo, click "Manage access", click "Invite a collaborator", then type their name in and click "Add ____ to _____".
        3. You then go back to your forked Repo and clone it by clicking "Code" and copy the https:// link.
        4. Open up your command line and input cd to the directory you want to put your clone of your forked Repo. Ie. "$ cd Desktop/"
        5. Once you're in your folder on command line, you input "git clone (clone url on GitHub)"
        6. Once cloned, input "cd" again but with the new directory in the clone url.
        7. In your project directory folder, use "git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname' command to make your own branch name for the Repo.
        8. Make changes within your editor for the code to get work completed.
        9. Add commit changes every 15-20 minutes to GitHub and add messages to the commits so everyone on your team is aware of the changes.
        10. Push your changes back up into your GitHub Repo online by inputing "git push -u origin branch-name" in command line.
        11. Return to your Repo on your GitHub account (make sure you're on YOUR forked copy and NOT the original Lambda one).
        12. Click on the "Branch:master" button to switch over to "name-branch" you created.
        13. After, click on "Pull Requests" on the top tab and then click "Create pull request".
        14. In the open a pull request page, make sure you're base repository matches your forked repo and NOT Lambdas!
        15. Add your TL to the reviewers on the right side of the page then click "create pull request".
        16. Remember: DO NOT MERGE YOUR OWN PULL REQUEST!
        17. Your TL will then merge the PR after they have done a review.
